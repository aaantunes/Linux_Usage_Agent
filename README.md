## Introfuction


# Architecture and Design
1) Draw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents
2) Describe tables (no SQL code, just usage)
3) Describe scripts (no code, ..)

## Usage
1) How to init db and tables
2) /`host_info.sh/` usage
3) /`host_usage.sh/` usage
4) crontab setup

## Improvements
